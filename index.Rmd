## Instructions
Northwestern University's Knight lab created a SQL murder mystery to help users sharpen their database skills by solving the crime that happened at SQL city. There are tables with different pieces of information - social media checkins, people, drivers licenses, crime scene reports, police interviews, and more. 

Pick R or SAS to start with, and solve the murder mystery, showing all of your work in this document. Then, once you've arrived at the answer, write the code in the other language that would allow you to get the same answer. 

When you are finished with the assignment: 

1. Save the file as 06_Lastname_Firstname.Rmd and compile it
2. Commit the Rmd file and corresponding html file to your homework git repo
3. Push the commit to github
4. Locate the Rmd file on github and click on the SHA link for the file.
5. Paste the url of the resulting page into Canvas to submit your assignment.

Your assignment must compile on a different computer as long as the saspath and DSN connection is set up correctly for that machine.

You can connect to the SQLite database in R or SAS, though in SAS you'll need to have a DSN connection set up. (Mine is below and should be similar to what you'd need on Windows/Mac).

Description = SQL Murder Mystery

Alternately, I have exported the tables as CSVs, and you can access those using the code at these links: [R](https://github.com/srvanderplas/unl-stat850/blob/master/code/06_sql-murder-setup.R), [SAS](https://github.com/srvanderplas/unl-stat850/blob/master/code/06_sql-murder-setup.sas)

You can copy the code from these repositories and include that code as your first code chunk.

A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a murder that occurred sometime on January 15, 2018 and that it took place in SQL City. All the clues to this mystery are buried in a huge database, and you need to use R and SAS to navigate through this network of information. Your first step to solving the mystery is to retrieve the corresponding crime scene report from the police department's database. 

This database schema may help you figure out how to navigate the database:

![sql-murder-mystery database schema diagram](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/sql-mysteries/blob/master/schema.png?raw=true)

## R
```{r data-setup-r, message = F, warning = F}

# Load all tables from CSV
source("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/srvanderplas/unl-stat850/master/code/06_sql-murder-setup.R")

library(tidyverse)
```


First, we probably need to retrieve the police report:
```{r}
case <- filter(crime_scene_report, date == 20180115, type == "murder", city == "SQL City")

case$description
```

We can follow these leads by looking in the person database:
```{r}
head(person)

witness1 <- filter(person, address_street_name == "Northwestern Dr") %>%
  # assume "last house" = highest number
  filter(address_number == max(address_number))

witness2 <- filter(person, address_street_name == "Franklin Ave",
                   str_detect(name, "Annabel"))

witnesses <- bind_rows(witness1, witness2)
```

Then, we can query the interview database for interviews with these witnesses:
```{r}
# Get all interviews with a person id that is in the witnesses table id column
statements <- semi_join(interview, witnesses, by = c("person_id" = "id"))

statements$transcript
```

In the first statement, we can see that we might need to query two databases: 
- `get_fit_now_member` to look for membership numbers starting with 48Z, and who are gold members
- `drivers_license` to look for license plates which include H42W

In the second statement, we would want to look at get_fit_now_check_in for a check in on January 9th. If there are multiple check-ins, we could also check to see what time they were there and find those who were present at the same time as the witness.

```{r}
# Statement 1 info:
suspect_1_gym <- get_fit_now_member %>%
  filter(str_detect(id, "48Z"), membership_status == "gold")

suspect_1_lic <- drivers_license %>%
  filter(str_detect(plate_number, "H42W")) %>%
  # Get the suspects names
  left_join(person, by = c("id" = "license_id"))

# Combine the information
suspect1 <- inner_join(suspect_1_gym, suspect_1_lic, by = "name")
suspect1
```

Does the 2nd statement corroborate the first?
```{r}
# statement 2 info
suspect2_gym_checkin <- get_fit_now_check_in %>%
  filter(check_in_date == 20180109)
suspect2_gym_checkin
```

But we have additional information: we know the witness was there at the same time:
```{r}
witness2_gym_info <- inner_join(get_fit_now_member, witness2, by = c("name", "person_id" = "id"))
# witness was there at the same time
witness2_gym_checkin <- inner_join(suspect2_gym_checkin, witness2_gym_info, by = c("membership_id" = "id"))

suspect2_gym_checkin <- filter(suspect2_gym_checkin, check_in_time < witness2_gym_checkin$check_out_time &
                                 check_out_time > witness2_gym_checkin$check_in_time) %>%
  # rule out the witness
  anti_join(witness2_gym_checkin) %>%
  # get names
  left_join(get_fit_now_member, by = c("membership_id" = "id"))

suspect2_gym_checkin
```

At this point, we can be pretty comfortable saying that Jeremy Bowers looks guilty. Is there an interview?

```{r}
bowers_interview <- interview %>%
  inner_join(suspect2_gym_checkin)
bowers_interview$transcript
```

According to the statement we're not done. 

```{r}
hired_the_killer <- drivers_license %>%
  # woman's description
  filter(between(height, 65, 67), hair_color == "red", car_make == "Tesla", car_model == "Model S") %>%
  left_join(person, by = c("id" = "license_id")) %>%
  rename(license_id = id, person_id = id.y) %>%
  inner_join(
    facebook_event_checkin %>%
      filter(between(date, 20171201,20171231), str_detect(event_name, "Symphony")) %>%
      count(person_id) %>%
      filter(n == 3)
  )

inner_join(hired_the_killer, income) %>%
  select(name, annual_income)
```

The killer was Jeremy Bowers, but he was hired by Miranda Priestly. 

## SAS

```

First, we get the description of the crime:
```{r, engine = "sashtml", engine.path = sasexe, engine.opts = sasopts, collectcode = T, error = T}
PROC PRINT DATA=crime_scene_report (WHERE= (date = 20180115 AND city = "SQL City" AND type = "murder")); RUN;
```

Next, we locate the witnesses:
```{r, engine = "sashtml", engine.path = sasexe, engine.opts = sasopts, collectcode = T, error = T}
PROC SQL;
CREATE TABLE witnesses AS
SELECT * FROM person
WHERE (address_street_name = "Northwestern Dr")
GROUP BY address_street_name 
HAVING address_number = max(address_number) ;

/* add info from witness 2 */
INSERT INTO witnesses
SELECT * FROM PERSON WHERE (address_street_name = "Franklin Ave")
HAVING name CONTAINS "Annabel";

PROC PRINT data = witnesses; RUN;
```

And we cross reference the statements...
```{r, engine = "sashtml", engine.path = sasexe, engine.opts = sasopts, collectcode = T, error = T}
PROC SQL;
CREATE TABLE witness_statements AS
SELECT coalesce(t1.id, t2.person_id) AS person_id, transcript
  FROM witnesses t1 
INNER JOIN interview t2 on (t1.id = t2.person_id);

PROC PRINT data = witness_statements; RUN;
```

Now we can get a list of people who meet the criteria in the statements:

Starting with statement 1.
```{r, engine = "sashtml", engine.path = sasexe, engine.opts = sasopts, collectcode = T, error = T}
PROC SQL;
/* Temporary table 1: matching gym members */
CREATE TABLE tmp1 AS
SELECT * FROM get_fit_now_member
  WHERE membership_status="gold" AND id CONTAINS "48Z";

/* Temporary table 2: drivers with matching plates */
CREATE TABLE tmp2 AS 
SELECT id AS license_id FROM drivers_license WHERE plate_number CONTAINS "H42W";

/* Temporary table 3: names for matching drivers */
CREATE TABLE tmp3 AS 
SELECT coalesce(t1.license_id, t2.license_id) AS license_id, t2.id AS person_id, t2.name FROM tmp2 t1
LEFT JOIN person t2 ON (t1.license_id = t2.license_id);

/* Suspect1: intersection of temp table 1 and tmp table 3 */
CREATE TABLE suspect1 AS 
SELECT coalesce(t1.name, t2.name) AS name, 
       coalesce(t1.person_id, t2.person_id) AS person_id, 
       t1.id AS membership_id, 
       t2.license_id, 
       t1.membership_status AS member_status 
FROM tmp1 t1 INNER JOIN tmp3 t2 ON (t1.name = t2.name AND t1.person_id = t2.person_id);

/* clean up */
DROP TABLE tmp1, tmp2, tmp3;
QUIT;

PROC PRINT data=suspect1;RUN;
```

We can confirm this with statement 2:
```{r, engine = "sashtml", engine.path = sasexe, engine.opts = sasopts, collectcode = T, error = T}
PROC SQL;
/* Temporary table 1: witness gym info */
CREATE TABLE witness_gym_member AS
SELECT coalesce(t3.membership_id, t4.membership_id) AS membership_id, 
       person_id, name, check_in_date, check_in_time, check_out_time
FROM 
( /* this is a subquery to get the witness gym membership info */
  SELECT coalesce(t1.person_id, t2.id) AS person_id, t1.id AS membership_id, 
       t2.name, t2.license_id FROM get_fit_now_member t1
  INNER JOIN witnesses t2 ON (t1.person_id = t2.id)) t3, 
/* And this table has her check-in info */
get_fit_now_check_in t4
WHERE t3.membership_id = t4.membership_id;


/* Temporary table 2: People at the gym on the 9th */
/* Add in extra columns for witness check-in time */
CREATE TABLE tmp2 AS 
/* columns in the result */
SELECT t1.membership_id, t1.check_in_date, t1.check_in_time, t1.check_out_time,
       t2.check_in_time AS witness_check_in_time, 
       t2.check_out_time AS witness_check_out_time FROM 
/* first table in join */
( SELECT * FROM get_fit_now_check_in 
  WHERE check_in_date = 20180109) t1, 
/* second table in join */
witness_gym_member t2
/* condition to check after join is completed */
/* ensure times overlap */
HAVING check_in_time < witness_check_out_time AND 
       check_out_time > witness_check_in_time;


/* Temporary table 3: names for matching gym members */
CREATE TABLE suspect2 AS 
SELECT t3.membership_id, 
       t3.check_in_date, t3.check_in_time, t3.check_out_time, 
       t3.person_id, t3.name FROM 
      /* subtable result 1: people at the gym on the 9th with names and person ids */
       (SELECT coalesce(t1.membership_id, t2.id) AS membership_id, 
         t1.check_in_date, t1.check_in_time, t1.check_out_time, 
         t2.person_id, t2.name
        FROM tmp2 t1, get_fit_now_member t2
        WHERE t1.membership_id = t2.id) t3
      /* subtable 2: witnesses */
/* proc sql does not have anti join, so do a left join and look for missingness */
LEFT JOIN witnesses t4 ON (t3.person_id = t4.id)
WHERE missing(t4.id)
;
/* clean up */
DROP TABLE witness_gym_member,tmp2;
QUIT;

PROC PRINT data=suspect2;RUN;
```

Lets get the union of the two suspect lists and see what statements we have from them:

```{r, engine = "sashtml", engine.path = sasexe, engine.opts = sasopts, collectcode = T, error = T}
PROC SQL;
CREATE TABLE tmp1 AS
  SELECT coalesce(t1.person_id, t2.person_id) AS person_id, 
         coalesce(t1.name, t2.name) AS name, 
         coalesce(t1.membership_id, t2.membership_id) AS membership_id, 
         t2.check_in_date, t2.check_in_time, t2.check_out_time, t1.license_id, t1.member_status 
  FROM suspect1 t1 FULL JOIN suspect2 t2 
  ON (t1.person_id = t2.person_id AND t1.name = t2.name AND t1.membership_id = t2.membership_id);

CREATE TABLE suspects AS
SELECT * FROM tmp1 t1 LEFT JOIN interview t2 ON t1.person_id = t2.person_id;

DROP TABLE suspect1, suspect2, tmp1;

QUIT;

PROC PRINT data=suspects;RUN;
```

So the suspect who was implicated in both witness statements is the only one with a police interview. And that suspect provides some information: 1, he's the killer, but 2, he was for hire. 

In the interest of justice, we have to go through and find the person who hired him.


```{r, engine = "sashtml", engine.path = sasexe, engine.opts = sasopts, collectcode = T, error = T}
PROC SQL;
/* Physical description of suspect and car */
CREATE TABLE sub_dl AS
SELECT coalesce(t1.id, t2.license_id) as license_id, 
    t1.hair_color, t1.height, t1.car_make, t1.car_model,
    t2.name, t2.id as person_id, t2.ssn
  FROM 
( SELECT * FROM drivers_license 
  WHERE hair_color = "red" AND 
      height > 64 AND 
      height < 68 AND 
      car_make = "Tesla" AND 
      car_model = "Model S" ) t1 
LEFT JOIN person t2 
ON (t1.id = t2.license_id);

/* Income */
CREATE TABLE sub_income AS
SELECT * FROM income t1 
RIGHT JOIN sub_dl t2 ON t1.ssn = t2.ssn;

/* Facebook checkins */
CREATE TABLE tmp AS
SELECT * FROM facebook_event_checkin
WHERE date > 20171130 AND
      date < 20180101 AND
      event_name CONTAINS "SQL Symphony";

CREATE TABLE sub_fb AS
SELECT COUNT(event_id) AS n, person_id FROM tmp
GROUP BY person_id
HAVING n=3;

DROP TABLE tmp;

CREATE TABLE culprit AS
SELECT name, person_id, annual_income, hair_color, height, car_make, car_model
FROM (
  SELECT coalesce(t1.person_id, t2.person_id) AS person_id, name, ssn, 
  t2.hair_color, t2.height, t2.car_make, t2.car_model
  FROM sub_fb t1 INNER JOIN sub_dl t2 ON t1.person_id = t2.person_id
) t3 LEFT JOIN income t4 ON t3.ssn = t4.ssn;

PROC PRINT DATA=culprit;RUN;
```

So once again, we know that Miranda Priestly hired Jeremy Bowers to commit murder.
