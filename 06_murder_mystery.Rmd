## Instructions
Northwestern University's Knight lab created a SQL murder mystery to help users sharpen their database skills by solving the crime that happened at SQL city. There are tables with different pieces of information - social media checkins, people, drivers licenses, crime scene reports, police interviews, and more. 

Pick R or SAS to start with, and solve the murder mystery, showing all of your work in this document. Then, once you've arrived at the answer, write the code in the other language that would allow you to get the same answer. 

When you are finished with the assignment: 

1. Save the file as 06_Lastname_Firstname.Rmd and compile it
2. Commit the Rmd file and corresponding html file to your homework git repo
3. Push the commit to github
4. Locate the Rmd file on github and click on the SHA link for the file.
5. Paste the url of the resulting page into Canvas to submit your assignment.

Your assignment must compile on a different computer as long as the saspath and DSN connection is set up correctly for that machine.

You can connect to the SQLite database in R or SAS, though in SAS you'll need to have a DSN connection set up. (Mine is below and should be similar to what you'd need on Windows/Mac).

[sqlmystery]
Description = SQL Murder Mystery
Driver = SQLite3
Database = /home/susan/Projects/Class/unl-stat850/2020-stat850/data/sql-murder-mystery.db

Alternately, I have exported the tables as CSVs, and you can access those using the code at these links: [R](https://github.com/srvanderplas/unl-stat850/blob/master/code/06_sql-murder-setup.R), [SAS](https://github.com/srvanderplas/unl-stat850/blob/master/code/06_sql-murder-setup.sas)

You can copy the code from these repositories and include that code as your first code chunk.


***

A crime has taken place and the detective needs your help. The detective gave you the crime scene report, but you somehow lost it. You vaguely remember that the crime was a murder that occurred sometime on January 15, 2018 and that it took place in SQL City. All the clues to this mystery are buried in a huge database, and you need to use R and SAS to navigate through this network of information. Your first step to solving the mystery is to retrieve the corresponding crime scene report from the police department's database. 

This database schema may help you figure out how to navigate the database:

![sql-murder-mystery database schema diagram](https://github.com/NUKnightLab/sql-mysteries/blob/master/schema.png?raw=true)

## R
```{r data-setup-r}
# Your database connection code goes here. Store the connection as con 
library(RSQLite)
library(DBI)
# This is what mine looks like with the DSN setup above
con <- dbConnect(RSQLite::SQLite(), "sqlmystery")
```

## SAS

```{sashtml data-setup-sas}
/* This is what my connection information looks like in SAS with the DSN set up */
libname murder odbc complete = "dsn=sqlmystery";
```
